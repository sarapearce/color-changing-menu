## Color Changing menu

This project is a small snipped that changes the color of a hamburger style menu svg to be in
visual contrast to the background color of the section.

## Installing

Drop the file or snippet directly into a jquery js file.
Update the colors for each section to match your preferences.

The code assumes the height of each section is the same as the viewport,
if this is not the case, the windowHeight variable needs to be adjusted.
